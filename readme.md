PowerPeg Thermal Management system for SMT components. 

SMT Thermal Connectors & Heatsinks

PowerPeg thermal connectors are designed for FR4 printed circuit board assemblies.

A selection of sizes allow the designer to accommodate any SMT heat source. Choose a connector which fits your IC. Design the PCB with a plated hole beneath the component. Solder the connector to the heat source.

Then, choose from a range of bolt-on coolers.
